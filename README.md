## Analyzing data with Pandas

This lesson assumes some programming background, but not necessarily with Python. Our focus is less on the details of the Python language and more on what tools like `pandas` and `matplotlib` allow us to do with tabular data. However, if you're new to Python, this notebook will give you some familiarity with general Python behavior.

We will learn how to do the following:

* Reading and manipulating tabular data with `pandas`
* Visualization and plotting data with `matplotlib`

and possibly as a bonus:

* Simple linear regression modeling of data with `scikit-learn`

This lesson is based on the [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) [``python-intermediate-mosquitoes``](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-intermediate-mosquitoes) lesson, and uses its datasets.
